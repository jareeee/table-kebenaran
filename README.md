# Truth Table Generator

This is a **dynamic truth table generator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input logical expressions and generate a corresponding truth table based on the selected variables. Users can add, update, and delete logical expressions, and the truth table will dynamically update based on the inputs.

## Features

- **Dynamic Variable Selection**: Choose the variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to include in the truth table.
- **Logical Expression Input**: Input logical expressions (e.g., `a && b`, `a || b`, `a ^ b`) and generate truth table results based on them.
- **Multiple Expressions**: You can add multiple expressions, and each expression will be displayed as a separate column in the truth table.
- **Update/Delete Expressions**: You can update or delete the logical expressions, and the truth table will update accordingly.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: The truth table is evaluated and displayed in real-time as you add or modify logical expressions.

## How to Use

1. **Select Variables**: Use the checkboxes at the top to select which variables you want to include in the truth table (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).
2. **Input Logical Expression**: Type in a valid logical expression (e.g., `a && b`, `a || b`) into the input box and click the "Generate Truth Table" button.
3. **Add More Expressions**: You can add more logical expressions, and each will appear as a new column in the table with the evaluated results.
4. **Update/Delete Expressions**: Under the "Expression List" section, you can update or delete existing expressions.

### Example Logical Expressions:

- `a && b` : Logical AND between `a` and `b`
- `a || b` : Logical OR between `a` and `b`
- `!a` : Logical NOT on `a`
- `a ^ b` : Logical XOR between `a` and `b`
